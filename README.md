# Purpose
These functions are intended to be for use in simulating general performance values for the rocket. The goal is for these to be very well documented simulations that are easy for new members and users to learn how to make use of. These will be another way of checking all of the values we get from other softwares, but their main advantage is meant to be teaching people the basics of rocket math. The general functions are written in normal MATLAB files for those who are experience with coding, but there are also some UI-like programs written in MATLAB live that should be more friendly to people who are new to coding.
